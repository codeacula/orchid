# Orchid Documentation

Welcome to the Orchid documentation! This directory contains all project documentation, including Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

## üìÅ Contents

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

The `/adr` directory contains Architecture Decision Records that document key architectural decisions made during the development of Orchid.

- [ADR-001: Architecture Overview](adr/001-architecture-overview.md) - Initial architecture decisions for the SPA/PWA with .NET 9 backend and Vue.js 3 frontend

### What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are documents that capture important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. Each ADR describes:

- The architectural decision to be made
- The context and forces influencing the decision
- The decision itself
- The consequences of the decision

### Creating New ADRs

When making significant architectural decisions, create a new ADR:

1. Copy the [ADR template](adr/template.md)
2. Number it sequentially (e.g., `002-next-decision.md`)
3. Fill in all sections
4. Submit it as part of your pull request
