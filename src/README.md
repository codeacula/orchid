## üöÄ Development

### Backend Development

```bash
cd Backend
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000` by default.

### Frontend Development

```bash
cd Frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server will be available at `http://localhost:8080` by default.

### Using Docker Compose

For full-stack development with all services:

```bash
# From the repository root
docker-compose up
```

This starts both backend and frontend services with hot-reload enabled.

## üß™ Testing

Tests for both backend and frontend are located in the `/tests` directory at the repository root.

## üì¶ Building for Production

### Backend

```bash
cd Backend
dotnet publish -c Release -o ./publish
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd Frontend
npm run build
```

The production build will be in the `dist` directory.

### Docker Images
